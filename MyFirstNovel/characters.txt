Nick Carraway stood at the edge of Gatsby’s lawn, the night thick with the scent of salt and something faintly metallic, like the dying embers of a dream too long held. He had been watching Gatsby from a distance, the way the man seemed to dissolve into the shadows of his own house, his face illuminated only when he turned toward the bay, where that single green light flickered on the far shore. Behind Nick, the sounds of revelry rolled on—glasses clinking, laughter high and sharp, the occasional crash of something fragile meeting an unforgiving floor. Tom Buchanan had just stalked past him, his face ruddy with drink and anger, his white dinner jacket thrown over one shoulder. He was muttering something about Gatsby, about how men like that never knew when to stop reaching. Daisy Buchanan trailed a step behind him, her eyes unfocused, her voice a ghost of a laugh as she leaned into Jordan Baker’s shoulder.

Inside, Jordan moved with a kind of careless grace, the way she always did, as if she had never been truly burdened by the weight of expectation. She glanced back at Nick, her dark eyes flashing with something he couldn’t quite name, something between amusement and challenge. “You shouldn’t look at them like that,” she murmured, following Nick’s gaze to Gatsby and the restless way he stood, hands tightening against the balustrade. “It won’t change anything.” But Nick wasn’t so sure. He had seen Gatsby’s belief in things that should have long since withered—his relentless pursuit of something already gone. And yet, Gatsby did not move. He stood there, waiting, as if his stillness might bend the world to his will, as if the past might slip through time and find him again.

Tom’s laughter cut through the air suddenly, sharp and hollow. He turned to Daisy, his voice low but not soft. “I hope you don’t think he can just wish it all away,” he sneered, his eyes flicking toward Gatsby as though the very sight of him was an affront. Daisy hesitated, smoothing the fabric of her dress as though its silk might give her some answer. Her lips parted, but no words came. There was a moment—just a flicker—where Nick thought she might turn, might say something that would set the night in a different direction. But then, just as quickly, she let Tom take her arm, guiding her back inside with the assurance of a man who had never once feared losing anything.

Gatsby still did not move. The music swelled behind them, the wail of a saxophone floating through the warm summer air. Jordan sighed and plucked a cigarette from her beaded clutch, lighting it with a practiced flick of her wrist. “Well,” she said, exhaling a thin curl of smoke, “I suppose that’s that.” But Nick wasn’t so sure. He watched Gatsby for a long time, standing alone on that great terrace, his silhouette carved against the glow of the city, his dream still lingering in the space between what was and what could never be.
